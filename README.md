# Regression Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores a regression task using housing data. The analysis includes dataset description, model comparison, insights, and recommendations for future improvement.

## 📁 Structure

- `notebooks/regression_analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook with all analysis and answers to the quiz.

## 🎯 Objective

To predict the average house prices based on features like income, population, and number of rooms, using different regression models.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (if used)

## 📊 Models Compared

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

## ✅ Results Summary

The Ridge Regression model demonstrated the best performance in terms of R² and generalization.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add geographical features (e.g., location, distance to city center)
- Test non-linear models like Decision Trees or Gradient Boosting
- Use cross-validation to improve reliability
